1) Typescript	
2) Angular
	create project
	create components
	create services			can access REST API
	create pipes

3) Spring Boot
	REST API
		data access


-----------------
ng new my-project
	choose routing (y/n) 		y
	css


once the project is created
	cd project-name
	ng serve-o


	once the project is served to the server, it is automatically opened in a new browser
		localhost:4200

lets open this project in VS Code
	File-> 	open folder
		open the project folder


An angular project is made up of 
	modules
		single module app
			"app" is the only module present in this project

	modules contain components	
	app.module.ts
		this is where we need to declare all the components and services we create
	
	date
		12-Mar-2020
		2020-03-12

	pipe is used to transform data into another form


	123.4567
		123.46

	

AppComponent
	is automatically created when we create a project

	other components we will create

what is component?
	in Angular we create components

	each component has
		presentation	HTML
		Style		CSS
		script		typescript


	ex:	App component has
			app.component.html
			app.component.css
			app.component.ts
			app.component.spec.ts			karma jasmine unit testing	


Let us learn to create few components and plug them into the app

	components can be parent and child
		we can plug one component inside another component



To create a component
	ng g c login

	what are the file will be created in this?
		login.component.html
		login.component.css
		login.component.ts
		login.component.spec.ts





login.component.ts
------------------
	public class Login	(java)
	LoginComponent



Bootstrap
-----------

external css
	how will you connect css and html


p
{
	text-align: center
}

<link rel=stylesheet href="mycss.css" >


User
	username
	password
	firstName
	lastName
	emailId
	phoneNo




how to bind the values in the user interface



	String username;
	String password;

	username:string;
	

Binding:
	ts variable is bound to html element

	{{username}}			this is called interpolation


	property binding		[]
	event binding			()
	two way data binding		[()]		Banana in the box

	value="x"				x is the value
	[value]="x"				x is a variable
	[(ngModel)]="x"



1) Template driven form		(now we are doing)
2) Reactive forms






in our project
	sign up 

		a new user is being created
		means, a row should be added to the usermaster table

	from angular, we are not sending lot of information. 
		we are sending only 1 object		of user

in typescript, we can create class
	ng g class user


JSON
	JavaScript Object Notation

	object is translated into a String

	{key:value,	key2:value2,	key3:value3	}




in angular, 
	whatever user enters in the signup form,
	is converted into a JSON object

	this object will be sent to 
		java code
		java code can store this as a record in database







Steps for accessing REST API:
------------------------------
	ANGULAR service should be created
		service is used to access rest api


	a service can access external world with the help of HttpClient

	in angular there is built in module called HttpClientModule		(we need to import this)

	import
		app.module.ts
