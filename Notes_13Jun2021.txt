form
	last week we learnt to bind the form elements to the model in 

"Template Driven Forms"
	today we learn to do the same using
"Reactive Forms"

	1) in app.module.ts
		we import 		ReactiveForms module

	2) here, it is model driven approach			(earlier we used template driven)
	

	.ts	we define the form as an object

	in previous approach
	we created HTML code and bound each element to a variable in typescript

	branch object	can be patched to a HTML form

Spring boot
	we can create a project from start.spring.io	website



Spring tool suite
	download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-E6GG4wZ6sPYQVUGnlKdgHft0o-X-z-/view?usp=sharing

	File -> New Spring starter project
		
	group Id:
		com.cts.hrms		com.companyname.projectname
	artifact id
		project-name

	in next screen choose
		spring web 
		lombok
			as dependency

	Lets run a hello world program
		go to src/main/java folder
			-> com.example.demo		(group id)

	we are going to create
		GET
		POST
		PUT
		DELETE

		these mappings 

	in all these methods, 
		Branch objects are stored or updated or delete or selected

	first of all,
	we need to create a Branch class
		
		bid, bname, bcity


	we need a repository that will
		add branch to the db		INSERT INTO
		modify branch			UPDATE 
		delete branch			DELETE
		get all branches		SELECT  *  FROM  Branch
		find branch by id		SELECT * FROM Branch WHERE bid=?

	we don't need to write sql queries in spring boot		NOT NECESSARY


	driver
	url
	username
	password

		thes info can be provided in "application.properties" file under src/main/resource

	in controller
		we provide URL for each method. this url will be used in angular to call these methods


	ctrl+shift+o		organize imports

1) mysql 
	better to install mysql workbench
	while downloading mysql, server also should be installed

	else, download wampp or xampp server


 CREATE TABLE branch
   (
    bid VARCHAR(6),
    bname VARCHAR(30),
    bcity VARCHAR(30),
    CONSTRAINT branch_bid_pk PRIMARY KEY(bid) 
   );






INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00001','Asaf ali road','Delhi');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00002','New delhi main branch','Delhi');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00003','Delhi cantt','Delhi');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00004','Jasola','Delhi');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00005','Mahim','Mumbai');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00006','Vile parle','Mumbai');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00007','Mandvi','Mumbai');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00008','Jadavpur','Kolkata');
INSERT INTO branch VALUES('B00009','Kodambakkam','Chennai');






in system env variables
	create a variable

1)	JAVA_HOME
		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281

		NOTICE THAT "bin" is not included in JAVA_HOME


2) 	Path
		append the below path (REMEMBER DO NOT OVER WRITE ALL THE PATHS)
			C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281\bin
